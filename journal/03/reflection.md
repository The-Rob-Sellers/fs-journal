# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I have been struggling with the amount of information (drinking through a firehose).  Additionally, the volume of learning has worn me out...finding the energy to be able to put in the required time for additional homework outside of the class time and checkpoints has been a significant challenge.

I knew this course wouldn't be easy, so I am not complaining, just beginning to understand my own limitations and working through it.  I believe you all when you tell me to trust the process, so I just keep showing up with a positive attitude and engage with the instructors/TAs/fellow students to absorb as much as I possibly can.

I appreciate the structure you all have for this program.  I would request that we take more frequent short breaks - my mind goes numb after 30-45 minutes, and I've heard the same from others.  (Plus, I tend to miss key info when I have to dash to a quick potty break!)  Just a thought <smiley emoji>

Thank you for another great week!
