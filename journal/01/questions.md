# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | Cloud back-up, website hosting, collaborative projects |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | Creating a new directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | Style is applied when additional factors are present - :Root /:hover / :checked |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Specificity help target specific elements with declarations - utilized to apply weights to specific variations in order to call them under specific conditions |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | I would quickly lose track of what is ACTUALLY important, no probably about it! |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | Selector, property (characteristic), value  |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | In addition to aesthetics, e-commerce can be impacted by website design - both positively and negatively.  Having a nice, clean, easy-to-navigate website will put the consumer and ease and help establish a good relationship with the merchant. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Visual representation of the final product to have a picture to code to |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Yes, especially if I am starting from scratch.  If I have a image or template, I don't yet see the value of using too much time on it |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | CSS property that causes the container to adjust size and passes the properties to the child elements contained within |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | Margin, Border, Padding, Item  |
