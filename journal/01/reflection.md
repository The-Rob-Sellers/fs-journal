# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I was able to be present (both physically and mentally) during the entirety of each day.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I knew it was going to be like drinking through a firehose, but I was surprised at how difficult is was for me to keep up.
- What are you struggling with?
Knowing that I am doing everything I need to do to past my first checkpoint.
- What would you count as a victory?
Learning better ways to take notes - focusing on step-order instead of details.
All-in-all it was a great first week - I'm still excited to have already made it through my first trough of disillusionment. ðŸ˜Ž
