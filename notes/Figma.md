Figma design tips!
Create a desktop frame (extend down for scrolling)
pick at least three colors to work with in boxes off to the size
low-fidelity mock layout = Nav bar, banner image, options menu/nav row (regions)
group elements = shift click, then ctrl-G - they move as one
stroke = create border element
cards within regions
bottons within cards
mid-fidelity = add colors
high-fidelity = replicate working mock
shrink mid-fid down and create a blank window called hi-fed
take one section at a time and add in text - keep styles clean for accessiblility
Poly-morph glass card effect very possible
Card shaping tools
add text using lorem ipsum plug-in
Final card = Hero card - over Hero image
Nav cards over options menu
Nav row good name for a group
group and name elements as much as possible to help with later:
Shop items, item card -> rename for each item
CREATE COMPONENT
Open a phone size screen and create components for the groups you want to copy to mobile
***wrap button in frames to prototype design links
creating a flow chart - prototyping tool emulates website user interactions
invite people and give them an option to view prototype mode
