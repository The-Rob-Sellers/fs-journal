BODY

SEction
MAIN
section
STUB = subsections

Once outline is complete, start working top to bottom

text-center will center an image inside of a column...justify-content won't always work.

.row / .col / .card / .card-body /.img / .p? .potion? to quick build!
.i for icon div (within p element)
onclick similar to class call in HTML
CAREFULLY name console logs for readability
Span keeps elements in the same line by default
don't use window.reload! ðŸ˜Š
